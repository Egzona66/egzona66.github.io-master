	 <p>An important tool in Neuroscience is to record brain responses to various tasks and/or stimuli. Presently, there are a few ways to measure brain activity noninvasively, for example: functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). With fMRI one can measure brain function through detecting changes in the blood flow during neural activity, assuming there is higher oxygen consumption by neurons when activated. An MEG on the other hand captures the magnetic field originating from neural activity. However, we were most interested in capturing the ionic current that flows in neuronal tissue situated on the cortex and results in fluctuating voltage which can be recorded and displayed as electrical activity, and measured with an EEG. 

In order to record during an EEG, small electrodes and wires are attached to different areas on your head, with some channels serving as reference channels (usually ears and head). EEG allows some relative spatial mapping through the use of multiple channels, however the resolution of time information is rather high. The circuitry within an EEG machine enables the amplification of the detected brainwaves and cancellation of external noise, to achieve a more accurate representation of the ongoing activity. These recorded signals are presented in wave patterns on a computer screen and can be used for further analysis. Similar to EEG is electromyography (EMG), which also measures electrical activity but in the muscles. 

For the last two weeks our assignment was to build an EEG/EMG circuitry and test it out (on ourselves). By testing out this circuitry we learned more about the communication that goes on between neurons and/or neurons and muscles. After we assembled all the necessary parts and put them together, we were able to listen to electrical impulses produced by muscles at rest and during contraction. When your brain expresses an intent to move a muscle, it cascades a process starting from your upper motor neurons (located in the motor cortex) that synapse with your lower motor neurons (located in the spinal cord) which finally synapse with your muscles (made of many muscle fibers). The release of acetylcholine between neuron and muscle (neuromuscular junction) causes a change in electrical potential which leads to an action potential in the muscle fiber, while this action potential makes its way across the muscle membrane it causes voltage gated calcium channels to open which causes the actual muscle contraction. A muscle contraction is therefore the result of many muscle fibers firing, which is what we record and can display as waves or even sound (if we connect our output signaling to a loudspeaker).
